# UDP
Coursework assignment 5 - TCP and UDP

A simple client-server application.

Multiple clients connect to a server. The first client to connect sends a looping audio recording to the server.
The server then relays the audio to all the clients who connect after this.


To run, on a local machine.

Compile and run a ServerImpl program.

Then run the ClientImpl program, passing a File in the command line arguments.
